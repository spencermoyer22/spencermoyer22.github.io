# Portfolio

## Description
This website is a portfolio meant to store my work and make myself look presentable for possible employers. I created this website using HTML and CSS to make a stylish, but professional portfolio of my work. To start the process I created all of the necessary files such as the index.html, style.css, and assets directory with the css and img directories.

To start the actual content of the website, I wireframed how I planned on making the website look in each separate section. I made some changes to the original wireframe, but it turned out mostly as I envisioned it. I then began to lay out the elements into the index.html file that I would need to get all of the content into the website that I needed. I used semantic elements to create containers for the different material to organize it properly. I inserted images in the neccesary places and made sure all of the links on the website worked properly as well.

After I had places all of the website's material into the index.html file, I moved on to style it with the style.css stylesheet. This was the longest part of the process. I went back to the index.html file when needed to place classes wherever I needed. I used a flexbox layout to make sure the material was positioned properly on the page as well. When I had finished adding the styles that I thought best fit the website, I used media queries to make the site responsive to other screen sized. This makes it possible to view a clean, professional site whether you are looking on a computer, tablet, or mobile device.
